# Phaser Architecture

### Why We need a Good Phaser Architecture?

It's important to structure a Game.
Here I decided to make a good structure with a good plan to make more easy the conception of a Game with Phaser.
Phaser is a framework who change every time! It's important to have an update easier as possible.
If you want to participate to my purpose, please, feel free to comment my work ;)
