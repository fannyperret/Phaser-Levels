# Phaser 2.10 Skeleton

### Why We need a Good Phaser Architecture?

It's important to structure a Game.
Here I decided to make a good structure with a good plan to make more easy the conception of a Game with Phaser.
Phaser is a framework who change every time! It's important to have an update easier as possible.

So here you can find a game with a particular State Management.
A part with levels if you want make a game like that but if it's not you case you can delete this part.
The player can walk, jump, kill some enemies and die. I wanted to use all the important parts that you need to create any games you want easier :)

If you want to participate to my purpose, please, feel free to comment my work ;)
